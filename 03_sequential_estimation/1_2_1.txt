Do you expect the batch estimate to be exactly (0, 1, -1)(0,1,âˆ’1) ?

No not exactly, it may differ from the real estimate, but should lie close to it depending on the number of samples.



Which two parameters can be used to make this estimate more accurate?

You can increase the number of samples n, or decrease the variance var to be more accurate.
