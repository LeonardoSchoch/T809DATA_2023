Both methods have 98.3 % accuracy on the dataset.
The confusion matrices look the same.

[15,  0,  0],
[ 0, 20,  1],
[ 0,  0, 23]

Since there is no visible difference between both methods we can ignore the prior probabilites and say that 
they are approximatly the same or have no great enough impact on the prediction outcome.
