The following parameters were set in the GradientBoostingClassifier.

    GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=5, max_depth=1, learning_rate=0.1)

In a test run I could achieve the following scores.

accuracy:  0.7873134328358209
precision: 0.7446808510638298
recall:    0.6796116504854369

Compared to the RandomForestClassifier it has almost equal accuracy, and precision but way better recall score.
